Supervised learning algorithm
# model

h(x) = sgn(XW) = sgn(w0 + w1*x1 + w2*x2)

# Loss function
Loss at one point data:
    Loss = -yi*(XiW) which (xi, yi) is a data point that's misclassified


# Algorithm:

while True:

    # do the sgd through all the data (one epoch)

    # check converge by counting the number of misclassified point (break when 0)


# Properties:
+ Many result
+ linear separable
